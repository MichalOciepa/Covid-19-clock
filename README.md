# Covid-19-clock
my first project with arduino (learning C)

Hello,
The watch presents data on morbidity and deaths due to coronavirus. 
I tried to regularly comment on my code. The buzzer was a problem for me. It was supposed to be in two tones, but I had to bypass the delay function.
The watch fulfills its role, displays current data and informs about new diseases in my way (with delay function) :)

Please comment if you have any tips.
