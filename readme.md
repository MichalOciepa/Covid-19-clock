# COVID-19 Clock project




## Project Overview üéâ
I'd like to show you my first C arduino project. I wanted to follow the situation in my country regarding covid-19. In addition to the basic watch function, it presents the number of morbidity and deaths due to covid. Notifies about the update with an alarm.

## Code Example/Issues üîç
Next to the code are my comments for better understanding. 
The buzzer was a problem for me. It was supposed to be in two tones, but I had to bypass the delay function.

## Installation üíæ
Cable connections as in the screenshot. I also present a scheme.
